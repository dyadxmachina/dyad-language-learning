description: Learning a language is difficult and it should be, learning any new form of expression is a brain altering process that takes commitment. I set out to learn my partner Haohan's Wang first learned language Mandarin more than three yeras ago. We took a very different approach which will explain. We will attempt to cover what worked and what did not. Along with an immersion plan. Learning as a dyad, has great advantages but since you are balancing a relationship it can be extremely difficult.
